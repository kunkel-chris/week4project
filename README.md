## Samsung Galaxy Week 4 Project

This repo contains one script "run_analysis.R" that processes the Samsung Galaxy 4 data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to create averages (means) and standard deviations for each measurement variable, for each subject and activity.

The script requires that the UCI data be in the working directory in a subfolder labeled "UCI HAR Dataset". If that folder is not present, the user can edit the script to specify the path in the call to the "getUCIdata" function.
